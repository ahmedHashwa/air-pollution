# Particulate Matter (PM) Pollution

This repository contains the files and code of my data science project about Beijin air Pollution. The goal of this project is to take the publically available Beijing weather data from 2013 to 2017 and apply machine learning techniques to see if we can predict the amount of PM2.5 concentration in the air given other environmental features. This is a project I am working on during my free time applying some of the machine learning algorithms I have learned. I hope to come up with a predictive model with a high accuracy and a very low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

# About the data

## Data Set Information:

This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration. The time period is from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.

## What is PM, and how does it get into the air?

PM stands for particulate matter (also called particle pollution): the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so small they can only be detected using an electron microscope.

Particle pollution includes:
* PM10 : inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller; and
*  PM2.5 : fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.How small is 2.5 micrometers? Think about a single hair from your head. The average human hair is about 70 micrometers in diameter â€“ making it 30 times larger than the largest fine particle.

### Sources of PM

These particles come in many sizes and shapes and can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals.

Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.

Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of complex reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles.

## What are the Harmful Effects of PM?

Particulate matter contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can be inhaled and cause serious health problems. Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can get deep into your lungs and some may even get into your bloodstream. Of these, particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, also known as fine particles or PM2.5, pose the greatest risk to health.

Fine particles are also the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States, including many of our treasured national parks and wilderness areas.
